# Java Basics
## Variables
The Java programming language defines the following kinds of variables:
* **Instance Variables** 
Instance Variables:  non-static variables and are declared in a class outside the constructor or method . 
* **Class Variables** 
Class variables also known as static variables are declared with the static keyword in a class, but outside a method, constructor or a block. 
There would only be one copy of each class variable per class, regardless of how many objects are created from it.
* **Local Variables** 
 Local variables are declared in methods, constructors, or blocks. Local variables are created when the method, constructor or block is entered and the variable will be destroyed once it exits the method, constructor, or block.
* **Parameters**
the Parameters is the variables that pass to the methods when it's called
## Primitive Data Types

| **Data Type** | **Size** | **Description** |
| ----------------- | ------------- | ---------- | 
| byte | 1 byte | Stores whole numbers from -128 to 127 |
| short | 	2 bytes|Stores whole numbers from -32,768 to 32,767 |
| int | 4 bytes |Stores whole numbers from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 |
| long | 8 bytes |Stores whole numbers from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 |
| float | 4 bytes |	Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 6 to 7 decimal digits |
| double | 8 bytes | Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 15 decimal digits |
| boolean | 1 bit | Stores true or false values |
| char | 2 bytes | Stores a single character/letter or ASCII values |

## Arrays
The array in JAVA contain a fix size and a single data type,the length defined when the array creation then still fixed.
