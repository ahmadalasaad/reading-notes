# Loops, Imports

## Loops

### types of loops that we can find in Java:

* **for loop**

When we know exactly how many times we want to loop through a block of code we used for loop.

```
for (initialization; Boolean-expression; step) {
  // code block
}

```
initialization is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block.

Boolean-expression defines the condition for executing the code block.

step is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed.

```
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  System.out.println(i);
}

```


* **While loop**

The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true

```
while (Boolean-expression) 
    statement;    
```

In the example below, the code in the loop will run, over and over again, as long as a variable (i) is less than 10:

```
int i = 0;
while (i < 10) {
  System.out.println(i);
  i++;
}

```

* **Do-While loop**

The do/while loop is a variant of the while loop. This loop will execute the code block once, before checking if the condition is true, then it will repeat the loop as long as the condition is true.

```
do {
    statement;
} while (Boolean-expression);

```

## Imports

We start the java source file with packages declaration 


The library is divided into packages and classes. So you can either import a single class , or a whole package that contain all the classes that belong to the specified package.
 
```
import package.name.Class;   // Import a single class
import package.name.*;   // Import the whole package

```

In this example the java.util is the package and the Scanner is the class 

```
import java.util.Scanner;
```
