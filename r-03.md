## Primitives vs. Objects

1. Default value and Null

Former can never be null if no value is assigned they take their default value (e.g boolean the default value is false ,int the default value is 0)

2. store

The primitives store value but the refrence store handl object in heap space .

3. Assigning value using Assignment Variable (=)

 primitive data types assign value, but when you assign an object to reference type, the handle is copied.

4. Comparison using == operator

Primitive variable compared with their values are compared but when you compare reference variable, their address is compared.

5. Memory consumption or Size

An int primitive variable will take less memory than an Integer object for storing the same value.

6. Stack vs Heap

Primitive variables are created in the stack, but reference variable is created in heap space.

## Exceptions in Java

An exception handling is defined as an abnormal condition that may happen at runtime and disturb the normal flow of the program. 

The Three Kinds of Exceptions:

1. checked exception: All exceptions are checked exceptions, except for those indicated by Error, RuntimeException, and their subclasse
2. error: external to the application
3. the runtime exception: internal to the application


```
try {
  // block of code that can throw exceptions
} catch (ExceptionType1 ex1) {
  // exception handler for ExceptionType1
} catch (ExceptionType2 ex2) {
  // Exception handler for ExceptionType2
} finally {
  // finally block always executes
}
```
