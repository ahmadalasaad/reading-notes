# OOP and number

## OPP
Object-oriented programming takes advantage of our perception of world:

* Objects with same characteristics are called instances of a class
* An object is an encapsulated completely-specifieddata aggregate containing attributes and behavior
* hiding data from other objects
* growing and shrinking collection of objects

**Benefits of object-oriented programming include:**

* reduced cognitive load 

* isolation of programmers so better to team programming

* less propagation of errors more adaptable/flexible programs

## Binary, Decimal and Hexadecimal Numbers

* Base 10 (Decimal) — Represent any number using 10 digits [0–9]
* Base 2 (Binary) — Represent any number using 2 digits [0–1]
* Base 16(Hexadecimal) — Represent any number using 10 digits and 6 characters [0–9, A, B, C, D, E, F]
