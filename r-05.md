# Linked Lists

 The LinkedList class is a collection which can contain many objects of the 
 same type and has many methods so you can add items, change items, remove 
 items and clear the list

The LinkedList stores its items in containers. The list has a link to the 
first container and each container has a link to the next 
container in the list. To add an element to the list, the 
element is placed into a new container and that container 
is linked to one of the other containers in the list.

 **So when we use the LinkedList and when we use ArrayList?**

 Use an ArrayList for storing and accessing data, and LinkedList to manipulate data.

 ```
public static void main(String args[]){

     LinkedList<String> list=new LinkedList<String>();

     //Adding elements to the Linked list
     list.add("ahmad");

     //Adding an element to the first position
     list.addFirst("Unkonow");

     //Adding an element to the last position
     list.addLast("last");

     //Adding an element to the second position
     list.add(1, "laith");

     //Iterating LinkedList
     Iterator<String> iterator=list.iterator();
     while(iterator.hasNext()){
       System.out.println(iterator.next());
     }
   } 
 ```
