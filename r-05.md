# Linked Lists and Big O

## Big O

It use to desicribe efficiency of an algorithm or function

there is two factor in Big O :

1. Tunning time (tie complexity): the time the algorithm needs to complete 

2. Memory Space complexity : the memory needed to store data and instruction

Big O provide the worst case so can take the worst case in the code and said this is O() of it 

look to the example:


* O(1)
```
int x;
x=5;

if(x=5){
  System.out.printls(x);
}

```

* O(n)

```
int x=30;

for(int i=0;i<x;i++){
  System.out.println(i);
}

```

* O(n^2)

```
int x=30;

for(int i=0;i<x;i++){
  for(int j=0;i<x;j++){
  
  System.out.println(j);
}}

```


## Linked Lists

 The LinkedList class is a collection which can contain many objects of the 

 same type and has many methods so you can add items, change items, remove 

 items and clear the list


The LinkedList stores its items in containers. The list has a link to the 

first container and each container has a link to the next 

container in the list. To add an element to the list, the 

element is placed into a new container and that container 

is linked to one of the other containers in the list.

**Linked list is a sequence of nodes that linked to each other , it has tow type:**

* Singly that has one refrence and it's point to the next node in the list

* Doubly that has two refrences and there point to next and previos nodes

**there is some property you should know about it linked list:**

Next  This property contains the reference to the next node.

Head - The Head is a reference of type Node to the first node in a linked list

Current - The Current is a reference of type Node to the node that is currently being looked at.


We dont use for and for each loops, we use while loop traverse.

We use while loop and declare *current* and assign an initial value equal *head* 

and  traverse through the list by make curent equal to current.next 

 **So when we use the LinkedList and when we use ArrayList?**

 Use an ArrayList for storing and accessing data, and LinkedList to manipulate data.


 ```



public static void main(String args[]){

     LinkedList<String> list=new LinkedList<String>();

     //Adding elements to the Linked list
     list.add("ahmad");

     //Adding an element to the first position
     list.addFirst("Unkonow");

     //Adding an element to the last position
     list.addLast("last");

     //Adding an element to the second position
     list.add(1, "laith");

     //Iterating LinkedList
     Iterator<String> iterator=list.iterator();
     while(iterator.hasNext()){
       System.out.println(iterator.next());
     }
   } 
 ```
