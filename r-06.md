# Inheritance and Interfaces

 **Object** 
 
 component has state and behavior .
 
  Objects can correspond to things found in the real world.

 
**Classes**

 Are a template for creating objects.

They encapsulate data with code to work on that data.

in real word we may find a many diffrent objects with 

same kind.So if we talk about vehicles all of themhave a 

properties (color,wheels) and methods(isDriving,...)

## Inheritance

If we talk about a previous example , so the vehicles have

a commen properties and methods but there are vehicles have

extra properties and methods , so we can use parent class called vehicle

to Inherite  commen properties and methods to the child vehicles

So vehicles class Inherite properties (color,wheels) and methods(isDriving) 

to the child (call it car class)and we can add another function

to the car called (hasRadio())like this all of vehcles have a  

properties (color,wheels) and methods(isDriving) but they havn't hasRadio().

## Interface

Methods form the object's interface with the outside world; 

In its most common form, an interface is a group of related 

methods with empty bodies.

It is used to achieve total abstraction. 

Since java does not support multiple inheritance in case of class, but by using 

interface it can achieve multiple inheritance  

## Package 

A package in Java is group related classes.

Think of it as a folder in a file directory.

We use packages to avoid name conflicts, and to write a better maintainable code.
