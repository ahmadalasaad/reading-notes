# OO Design

## Don't repeat yourself

The Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle states that duplication in programming 

should be eliminated by abstraction. 

Adding additional and  unnecessary code to a codebase increases the amount of work

required to extend and maintain the software in the future.

Whether the duplication stems from Copy Paste Programming or poor understanding

of how to apply abstraction, it decreases the quality of the code.  Duplication

in process is also waste if it can be automated.

Manual testing, manual build and integration processes, etc. should all be eliminated 

whenever possible throughthe use of automation.

## Rule of three (computer programming)

Duplication in programming is bad, because it make the programming hard to maintain and 

reusability,so we should use abstracting and interdacing to get the minimum size code .

You are allowed to copy and paste the code once, but that when the same code is replicated 

three times, it should be extracted into a new procedure.

## You aren't gonna need it

I will summerize this in one statment:

just write the methods or the code you need and dont write anything you will not use it so

dont writea method then force yourself to use it .

## Minimum viable product

Minimum Viable Product or MVP is a development technique in which a new product is introduced 

in the market with basic features, but enough to get the attention of the consumers. 

The final product is released in the market only after getting sufficient feedback from the 

product's initial users.
