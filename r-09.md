# WRRC and Java

* **Step 1: Local Processing**
1. the browser will extract the protocol, port number and query
2. the browser need to resolve the IP address then look through its own cache of recently 
requested URLs, the operating system’s cache of recent queries, your router’s cache, and your DNS cache.

* **Step 2: Resolve an IP**

If the response makes it back, the requesting client now has a target IP.
If the cache lookup fails , your browser fires off a DNS request using UDP3.
Your request will now have to travel many network devices to reach its target DNS server.
Once your request arrives at your configured DNS server, the server looks for the address 
associated with the requested hostname.

 * **Step 3: Establish a TCP Connection**
when the request was sent over TCP6, which is a transport layer protocol like UDP, the client
must open a TCP connection.

* **Step 4: Send an HTTP Request**

1. The request is made up of a “request line”, request header, and a body.
2. Once the HTTP request is sent, it follows a similar routing procedure as the one discussed 
earlier, with the difference being that using TCPs magic sequence number powers, the server can 
ensure it receives the whole request, in the correct order.
3. Once the server receives the request, processes it, and finds the resource being requested, 
it generates an HTTP response
4. Once the response is generated, the server responds to the request

* **Step 5: Tearing Down and Cleaning Up**
1. Once the response has been fully delivered, the client sends a FIN packet at the TCP level, 
to which the server responds with an ACK, and then generally sends a FIN of its own, which the
client responds to with its own ACK signal.
2. browser begins processing what it has received.
