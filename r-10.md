# Stacks and Queues

## What is a Stack

The stack is a data structure consist of Node each Node refrence to the next one but not refrence to the previous one.

**Common terminology for a stack is**

* Push : the Node that put into the stack are pushed
* Pop : the Node that remove into the stack are popped
* Top : This is the top of the stack.
* Peek : When you peek you will view the value of the top Node in the stack. When you attempt to peek an empty stack an exception will be raised.
* IsEmpty : returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false.

**Stacks follow these concepts:**

**FILO**

First In Last Out

First item added in the stack will be the last item popped out of the stack.

**LIFO**

Last In First Out

Last item added to the stack will be the first item popped out of the stack.

## O()

### Pusho(1)

the O() for push alwase is O(1) because you willl just assign the newNode.next to the top Node then assgin the 

top to the new Node .

```
   Node newNode = new Node(value);
   node.next = top;
   top = newNode;

```

### Pop O(1)

create refrence called temp and it point to the same point for the top 

assign the top for the next value so top=top.next

now we can remove the Node without affecting to the rest of the stack 

so the next of temp eqyual null and finally return the value of temp

```
   Node temp = top;
   top = top.next;
   temp.next = null;
   return temp.value;

```

### Peek O(1)

When conducting a peek, you will only be inspecting the top Node of the stack.

//input nothing // output top of the stack

### IsEmpty O(1)

// input nothing // output boolean


## What is a Queue


**Common terminology for a queue is**

* Enqueue : Nodes  are added to the queue.
* Dequeue : Nodes  are removed from the queue.
* Front : This is the first Node of the queue.
* Rear : This is the last Node of the queue.
* Peek :  The value of the front Node in the queue.
* IsEmpty : returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false.


**Queues follow these concepts:**

**FIFO**

First In First Out

First item in the queue will be the first item out of the queue.

**LILO**

Last In Last Out

Last item in the queue will be the last item out of the queue.


## O()

### Enqueue O(1)

for this action the O() alwase O(1) because we deal with the rear only 

so we need make the rear.next with new Node  then make rear the new node

```
   Node newNode = new Node(value)
   rear.next = newNode
   rear = newNode

```

### Dequeue O(1)

also this alwase O(1) because we deal with front only

create a refrence called temp and assign it to the front the make the the front equal front.next
now we can remove without lost the rest of the queue so the temp.next equal null
then return the value of the temp

```
   Node temp = front ;
   front = front.next;
   temp.next = null;

   return temp.value;
```
### Peek O(1)

When conducting a peek, you will only be inspecting the front Node of the queue.

//input nothing // output front of the queue

### IsEmpty O(1)

// input nothing // output boolean
