# Spring

### Starting with Spring Initializr

**This guides for Java and gradle** 

* Navigate to https://start.spring.io. This service pulls in all the dependencies you need for an application and does most of the setup for you.
* Click Dependencies and select Spring Web, Thymeleaf, and Spring Boot DevTools.
* Click Generate.
* Download the resulting ZIP file, which is an archive of a web application that is configured with your choices.

### Create a Web Controller

* HTTP requests are handled by a controller.
* Identify the controller by the @Controller annotation.
* In the following example, GreetingController handles GET requests for /greeting by 
returning the name of a View (in this case, greeting). 
* A View is responsible for rendering the HTML content. 
* The following listing (from src/main/java/com/example/servingwebcontent/GreetingController.java) shows the controller:
```
package com.example.servingwebcontent;

import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller;
import org.springframework.ui.Model;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestParam;

@Controller
public class GreetingController {

	@GetMapping("/greeting")
	public String greeting(@RequestParam(name="name", required=false, defaultValue="World") String name, Model model) {
		model.addAttribute("name", name);
		return "greeting";
	}

}
```

* The @GetMapping annotation ensures that HTTP GET requests to /greeting are mapped to the greeting() method.
* @RequestParam binds the value of the query string parameter name into the name parameter of the greeting() method. 
* If it is absent in the request, the defaultValue of World is used. 
* The value of the name parameter is added to a Model object, ultimately making it accessible to the view template.
* The implementation of the method body relies on a view technology (in this case, Thymeleaf) to perform server-side rendering of the HTML. 
* Thymeleaf parses the greeting.
* html template and evaluates the th:text expression to render the value of the ${name} parameter that was set in the controller.
* The following listing (from src/main/resources/templates/greeting.html) shows the greeting.html template:

```
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html xmlns:th="http://www.thymeleaf.org">
<head> 
    <title>Getting Started: Serving Web Content</title> 
    <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />
</head>
<body>
    <p th:text="'Hello, ' + ${name} + '!'" />
</body>
</html>
```
### Spring Boot Devtools

Spring Boot Devtools:
* Enables hot swapping
* Switches template engines to disable caching.
* Enables LiveReload to automatically refresh the browser.
* Other reasonable defaults based on development instead of production.

### Run the Application

 The following listing (from src/main/java/com/example/servingwebcontent/ServingWebContentApplication.java) shows the application class:

 ```
 package com.example.servingwebcontent;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

@SpringBootApplication
public class ServingWebContentApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(ServingWebContentApplication.class, args);
    }

}
 ```

 
**@SpringBootApplication is a convenience annotation that adds all of the following:**

* @Configuration: Tags the class as a source of bean definitions for the application context.
* @EnableAutoConfiguration: Tells Spring Boot to start adding beans based on classpath settings, other beans, and various property settings. 
* @ComponentScan: Tells Spring to look for other components, configurations, and services in the com/example package, letting it find the controllers.

### Build an executable JAR

you can run the application by using ./gradlew bootRun. Alternatively, 
you can build the JAR file by using ./gradlew build and then run the JAR file

### Test the Application

Visit http://localhost:8080/greeting, where you should see “Hello, World!”

Static resources, including HTML and JavaScript and CSS, can be served from 
your Spring Boot application by dropping them into the right place in the source code. 
By default, Spring Boot serves static content from resources in the classpath at /static (or /public). 
The index.html resource is special because, if it exists, it is used 
as a "`welcome page,"serving-web-content/ which means it is served up as the root resource (that is, at`
http://localhost:8080/). 
As a result, you need to create the following file (which you can find in src/main/resources/static/index.html):

```
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
<head> 
    <title>Getting Started: Serving Web Content</title> 
    <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />
</head>
<body>
    <p>Get your greeting <a href="/greeting">here</a></p>
</body>
</html>
```
