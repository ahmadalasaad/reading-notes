# Related Resources and Integration Testing

## One-to-One Relationship

* The Data Model

The @RestResource annotation is optional and can be used to customize the endpoint.

```
@Entity
public class Address {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue
    private long id;

    @Column(nullable = false)
    private String location;

    @OneToOne(mappedBy = "address")
    private Library library;

    // standard constructor, getters, setters
}
```
*  The Repositories
 creating repositories by extendes the Crud
 ```
 public interface LibraryRepository extends CrudRepository<Library, Long> {}
public interface AddressRepository extends CrudRepository<Address, Long> {}
 ```

 * Creating the Resources
 Creating libraries to working on them
 ```
 curl -i -X POST -H "Content-Type:application/json" 
  -d '{"name":"My Library"}' http://localhost:8080/libraries
 ```

 the API will returnjson file 

* Creating the Associations

This is done using the HTTP method PUT, which supports a media type of text/uri-list, 
and a body containing the URI of the resource to bind to the association

## One-to-Many Relationship

A one-to-many relationship is defined using the @OneToMany and @ManyToOne annotations 
and can have the optional @RestResource annotation to customize the association resource

* The Data Model

the “many” end of a relationship with the Library entity:
```
@Entity
public class Book {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue
    private long id;
    
    @Column(nullable=false)
    private String title;
    
    @ManyToOne
    @JoinColumn(name="library_id")
    private Library library;
    
    // standard constructor, getter, setter
}
```
*  The Repositories

making repositories for te books

```
public interface BookRepository extends CrudRepository<Book, Long> { }

```
* Creating the Resources

add a book to a library

```
curl -i -X POST -d "{\"title\":\"Book1\"}" 
-H "Content-Type:application/json" http://localhost:8080/books

```
verify the books in the library by using GET method on the library's /books association resource:

```
curl -i -X GET http://localhost:8080/libraries/1/books

```
## Many-to-Many Relationship

A many-to-many relationship is defined using @ManyToMany annotation, to which we can add @RestResource.

* The Data Model

```
@Entity
public class Author {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue
    private long id;

    @Column(nullable = false)
    private String name;

    @ManyToMany(cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
    @JoinTable(name = "book_author", 
      joinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "book_id", referencedColumnName = "id"), 
      inverseJoinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "author_id", 
      referencedColumnName = "id"))
    private List<Book> books;

    //standard constructors, getters, setters
}
```

* The Repository

```
public interface AuthorRepository extends CrudRepository<Author, Long> { }

```

* The Association Resources

create an Author instance by sending a POST requests to the /authors collection resource:

```
curl -i -X POST -H "Content-Type:application/json" 
  -d "{\"name\":\"author1\"}" http://localhost:8080/authors

```

Next, let's add a second Book record to our database:

```
curl -i -X POST -H "Content-Type:application/json" 
  -d "{\"title\":\"Book 2\"}" http://localhost:8080/books
```
