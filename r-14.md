# Trees

* Node  A : Tree node is a component which may contain it’s own values, and references to other nodes
* Root : The root is the node at the beginning of the tree
* K : A number that specifies the maximum number of children any node may have in a k-ary tree.
* Left : A reference to one child node
* Right : A reference to the other child node
* Edge : The edge in a tree is the link between a parent and child node
* Leaf : A leaf is a node that does not have any children
* Height : The height of a tree is the number of edges from the root to the furthest leaf

## Traversals

tho most important thing in trees is how to search for the node 

 There are two categories of traversals:
* Depth First
* Breadth First

### Depth First

going through the depth (height) of the tree first

Here are three methods for depth first traversal:

* Pre-order: root >> left >> right

```
  OUTPUT <-- root.value

  if root.left is not NULL
      preOrder(root.left)

  if root.right is not NULL
      preOrder(root.right)

```
* In-order: left >> root >> right
```
 if root.left is not NULL
        inOrder(root.left)

    OUTPUT <-- root.value

    if root.right is not NULL
        inOrder(root.right)
```
* Post-order: left >> right >> root
```
    if root.left is not NULL
        postOrder(root.left)

    if root.right is not NULL
        postOrder(root.right)

    OUTPUT <-- root.value
```
### Breadth First

iterates through the tree by going through each level of the tree node-by-node

 built-in queue to implement a breadth first traversal

 ```
  Queue breadth <-- new Queue()
  breadth.enqueue(root)

  while breadth.peek()
    node front = breadth.dequeue()
    OUTPUT <-- front.value

    if front.left is not NULL
      breadth.enqueue(front.left)

    if front.right is not NULL
      breadth.enqueue(front.right)
 ```


 ## K-ary Trees

If Nodes are able have more than 2 child nodes, we call the tree that contains them a K-ary Tree. In this type of tree we use K to refer to the maximum number of children that each Node is able to have.


### Breadth First Traversal

We will still start at the root Node, and we will add it to our queue

Much like before, as long as we have a node in our queue we can dequeue

With every Node we dequeue, we check it’s list of childre and enqueue each one

Once these are queued up, can move on to Node B at the front of the queue, which we 
can dequeue followed by enqueing Node B’s children

This process of dequeuing and processing the Nodes at the front of the queue, followed 
by enqueing the current Node’s children continues until our queue is empty of child Nodes

```
  Queue breadth <-- new Queue()
  breadth.enqueue(root)

  while breadth.peek()
    node front = breadth.dequeue()
    OUTPUT <-- front.value

    for child in front.children
        breadth.enqueue(child)
```

### Big O

* inserting a new node : O(n)
*  Searching for a specific node: O(n) 
* The Big O space complexity for a node insertion using breadth first insertion : O(W)  w is the largest width of the tree
* binary tree max width 2^(h-1) the height = log n

## Binary Search Trees

### Searching a BST
let’s say we are searching 15. We start by comparing the value 15 to the value of the root, 23.

15 < 23, so we traverse the left side of the tree. We then treat 8 as our new “root” to compare against.

15 > 8, so we traverse the right side. 16 is our new root.

15 < 16, so we traverse the left side. And aha! 15 is our new root and also a match with what we were searching for.
### Big O

 insertion and search operations is O(h)

 Big O space complexity O(1)
