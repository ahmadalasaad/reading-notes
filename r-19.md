# WebSocket
## Real time messaging with websockets

**This tutorial will show you how to make a "Hello, world" program that sends messages back and forth between a browser and a server.**

WebSocket is a thin, lightweight overlay that sits on top of TCP. 
This makes it possible to incorporate messages using "subprotocols.
" STOMP is a subprotocol that runs on top of WebSocket, which is a lower-level protocol. 
Create a server that can accept a message including a user's name. 
The server will respond by inserting a greeting into a queue to which the client has subscribed. 
Using Spring Initializer, start from the beginning. This guide's source 
repository may be downloaded and unzipped, or you can clone it using 
Git: git clone https://github.com/spring-guides/gs-messaging-stomp-websocket.git. 
You may compare your findings to the code in gs-messaging-stomp-websocket/complete once you've finished.

## setup environment

**Start using Spring Initializr or, if you're using Gradle**

* go to Spring Initializr to create a new project with the necessary dependencies.
* Add Gradle dependencies if needed.

* After you've created your STOMP messaging service, you'll need to make a resource representation class. 

* Consider service interactions to start the process. The service will receive STOMP messages with a name in the body and a JSON object in the body. Using @Controller classes, create a message-handling controller. 
* The greeting() function is triggered if a message is sent to the /hello endpoint, thanks to the @MessageMapping annotation. 

* The message's payload is attached to a HelloMessage object, which is given into greetings(). 

* Create a Java class called WebSocketConfig to configure Spring for STOMP communications. The annotation @Configuration indicates that WebSocketConfig is a Spring configuration class. It's also marked with @Enable. WebSocketMessageBroker is a message broker that facilitates WebSocket message processing. 
* The configureMessageBroker() function implements the WebSocketMessageBrokerConfigurer's default way for configuring the message broker. 

* The registerStompEndpoints() function registers the /gs-guide-websocket endpoint, allowing SockJS fallback options to be utilized if WebSocket is not available. 

* Create an index.html file for the browser client. 
* The SockJS and STOMP javascript libraries are imported into the HTML page, which will be used to connect with our server through STOMP via websocket. We also provide app.js, which includes our client application's functionality. The connect() and sendName() methods are the most important parts of the JavaScript code to comprehend. 

* The connect() function opens a connection using SockJS and stomp.js, and the sendName() function obtains the user's name and sends it to the /app/hello destination using the STOMP client. 

* Make the application executable by using Spring Boot's application class generator. It doesn't need to be changed in this situation. This program may be run with it. Create an executable JAR - You may use Gradle or Maven to launch the application from the command line. 

* You may alternatively create a single JAR file that contains all of the required dependencies, classes, and resources and execute it. It's simple to ship, version, and deploy the service like an application throughout the development lifecycle, across multiple environments, and so on by creating an executable jar. 

* You may execute the application with./gradlew bootRun if you're using Gradle. Alternatively, you may use./gradlew build to create the JAR file, then run java -jar build/libs/gs-messaging-stomp-websocket-0.1.0.jar to execute it. To test the service, navigate to http://localhost:8080 in your browser and click the Connect button.
