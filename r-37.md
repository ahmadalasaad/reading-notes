# S3

## What is Amazon S3?
- Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is storage for the Internet. It is designed to make web-scale computing easier.
- Amazon S3 has a simple web services interface that you can use to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web.

**Advantages of using Amazon S3**

* Creating buckets : Create and name a bucket that stores data.
* Storing data : Store an infinite amount of data in a bucket. Upload as many objects as you like into an Amazon S3 bucket.
* Downloading data : Download your data or enable others to do so.
* Permissions : Grant or deny access to others who want to upload or download data into your Amazon S3 bucket.
* Standard interfaces – Use standards-based REST and SOAP interfaces designed to work with any internet-development toolkit.

**Amazon S3 concepts**
***Buckets***
if the object named `photos/puppy.jpg` is stored in the `awsexamplebucket1` bucket in the US West (Oregon) Region, then it is addressable using the URL `https://awsexamplebucket1.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/photos/puppy.jpg`.

***Objects***
Objects are the fundamental entities stored in Amazon S3. Objects consist of object data and metadata. The data portion is opaque to Amazon S3.

***Keys***
A key is the unique identifier for an object within a bucket. Every object in a bucket has exactly one key. The combination of a bucket, key, and version ID uniquely identify each object.
