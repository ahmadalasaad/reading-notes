# Wireframing
Wireframing is a practice used by UX designers which allows them to

define and plan the information hierarchy of their 

design for a website, app, or product. 

This process focuses on how the designer or client wants the user to 

process information on a site, based on the user 

research already performed by the UX design team.

## How to make your wireframe in six steps

1. Do your research

2. Prepare your research for quick reference

3. Make sure you have your user flow mapped out

4. Draft, don’t draw. Sketch, don’t illustrate

5. Add some detail and get testing

6. Start turning your wireframes into prototypes


# HTML
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure

a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured 

within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using 

images and data tables.

As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic

understanding of HTML and its functions.

# Semantic
In programming, Semantics refers to the meaning of a piece of code — 

for example "what effect does running 

that line of JavaScript have?", or "what purpose or role does that 

HTML element have" (rather than "what does it look like?".)

### Semantics in JavaScript
In JavaScript, consider a function that takes a string parameter, and 

returns an <li> element with that string as its textContent.

### Semantics in CSS

In CSS, consider styling a list with li elements representing 

different types of fruits.

### Semantics in HTML

In HTML, for example, the <h1> element is a semantic element, which 

gives the text it wraps around the role (or meaning) of "a top level 

heading on your page."
